# Starklings Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the Starklings exercises, which can be found at [starklings.app](https://starklings.app/exercise).

## About Starklings

Starklings is an interactive learning platform for Cairo, the programming language used in Starknet. These exercises are designed to help developers learn Cairo development through hands-on practice.

## Progress

I'm currently working through the exercises to improve my Cairo development skills. This repository will be updated as I complete more challenges.
